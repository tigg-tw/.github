### About Us 
Taichung Indie Game Group (TiGG) is a non-profit community organization founded by a group of passionate independent game enthusiasts in Central Taiwan. Our mission is to create a dedicated platform for ACG (Anime, Comics, and Games) events in the central region, allowing local indie game developers and fans to connect, share, and grow together.

Currently, we only meet in Taichung, so we primarily use **Traditional Chinese**. At the same time, we also hope to have sponsors who can support our community activities.

### History of the Taichung Independent Game Community
In 2020, there were three communities in Taichung promoting game development. To effectively integrate resources, DCD took charge of resource integration and promotion. Until July 2024, after DCD completes its phased tasks, community management will return to the enthusiasts.
